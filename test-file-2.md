# Project Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the project architecture and key components. It is intended for developers who are new to the project and need to understand how everything fits together.

## System Architecture

The system is built using a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Frontend**: React-based single-page application with TypeScript
- **API Gateway**: Express.js server that routes requests
- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication, authorization, and session management
- **Data Service**: Manages data storage, retrieval, and caching
- **Notification Service**: Handles email, SMS, and push notifications
- **Analytics Service**: Tracks user behavior and system performance

### Communication Flow

1. User interacts with the Frontend
2. Frontend makes requests to the API Gateway
3. API Gateway authenticates and authorizes requests
4. API Gateway routes requests to appropriate services
5. Services process requests and return responses
6. API Gateway aggregates responses and returns to Frontend

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/example/project.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
nano .env

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Testing

We use Jest for unit testing, React Testing Library for component tests, and Cypress for end-to-end testing. To run tests:

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run component tests
npm run test:components

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Deployment

The application is deployed using Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes. The deployment process is automated using GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines.

### Production Environment

- AWS EKS for Kubernetes
- RDS for database
- S3 for static assets
- CloudFront for CDN
- AWS Lambda for serverless functions

## Monitoring

We use the following tools for monitoring:

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Sentry for error tracking
- ELK stack for log management
