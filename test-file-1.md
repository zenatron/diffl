# Project Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the project architecture and key components. It is intended for developers who are new to the project and need to understand how everything fits together.

## System Architecture

The system is built using a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Frontend**: React-based single-page application
- **API Gateway**: Express.js server that routes requests
- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization
- **Data Service**: Manages data storage and retrieval
- **Notification Service**: Handles email and push notifications

### Communication Flow

1. User interacts with the Frontend
2. Frontend makes requests to the API Gateway
3. API Gateway routes requests to appropriate services
4. Services process requests and return responses
5. API Gateway aggregates responses and returns to Frontend

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/example/project.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Testing

We use Jest for unit testing and Cypress for end-to-end testing. To run tests:

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Deployment

The application is deployed using Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes. The deployment process is automated using CI/CD pipelines.

### Production Environment

- AWS EKS for Kubernetes
- RDS for database
- S3 for static assets
- CloudFront for CDN
